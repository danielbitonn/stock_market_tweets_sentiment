# **1. Abstract**
Due to the development of social networks in the last two decades and the implications of these in our daily, it has made it possible for companies or market makers to affect the stock market through their news and postings. 

**Does that make sense?**

This project deals with assessing and analyzing the effect of social network information on investors and should help him make decisions and manage risk more effectively alongside other technical tools, fundamental analysis, and so on. 

A study from the University of Maryland found that the content of tweets made by corporations on Twitter affected their share price.
Therefore, I focused on Twitter's trends and influencers in the context of the stock market. 
Identify the sentiment of tweets based on lexicon models used for sentiment analysis (also known as opinion mining or emotion AI), a sub-field of NLP that tries to identify and extract opinions within a given text across blogs, reviews, and social media, forums, news, etc.

This analysis will be exploited to determine if there is any influence and how much influence it has on the market prices of the top companies. In addition, examine influencers' (public opinion leader) tweets and activities based on engagement determined by calculating retweets, amount of comments, likes, and so forth.
